## 🤔 **SIZE DIFFERENCE EXPLANATION:**

### **Why Different Sizes?**

**Original Model (35.1 MB):** Full DenseNet121 architecture with all layers and weights
**Active Classifier (470 KB):** Likely a processed/optimized version or different format

**Possible Explanations:**
1. **🔧 Model Optimization:** The classifier might be a quantized or compressed version
2. **📦 Different Format:** Could be saved in a more compact format
3. **⚙️ Processing Pipeline:** May have been processed during activation
4. **🧠 Architecture Differences:** Could be using only the essential layers
